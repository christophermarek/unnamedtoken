The new trend is BUSD rewards/reflections

Every time someone sells, a portion of the sold token amount is allocated away for rewarding all holders. These allocated tokens are then sold for BUSD and split among all token holders.

Like letâ€™s say you sell 100 tokens and contract allocates 10% of all sold tokens for BUSD rewards.

Your 100 sold tokens ends up being 90.

The remaining 10 tokens are then sold for BUSD which is then split among all holders.
